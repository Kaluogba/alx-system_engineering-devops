Issue Summary:
Duration:
Start Time: January 15, 2024, 14:30 UTC
End Time: January 15, 2024, 16:45 UTC
Impact:
The user authentication service experienced a complete outage.
Users were unable to log in, and approximately 80% of the user base was affected.
Root Cause:
A database connection leak caused a cascading failure, exhausting available connections.
Timeline:
Issue Detection:
Detected at 14:30 UTC through automated monitoring alerts indicating a spike in failed authentication attempts.
Actions Taken:
Investigated the authentication service logs to identify the source of failures.
Assumed initially that the issue might be related to a recent code deployment.
Misleading Paths:
Explored potential code changes introduced in the last deployment, leading to temporary rollback attempts.
Investigated network configurations, suspecting connectivity issues between the authentication service and the database.
Escalation:
Escalated the incident to the database administration team when initial investigations did not reveal the root cause.
Resolution:
Identified an open database connection leak in the authentication service code.
Temporarily increased the database connection limit to restore service while addressing the code issue.
Applied a hotfix to close leaking connections and deployed the fix.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause:
The authentication service code was not properly closing database connections, leading to a gradual exhaustion of available connections in the pool.
Resolution:
Implemented a code fix to ensure proper closure of database connections after usage.
Conducted a database connection pool optimization to prevent future leaks.
Adjusted monitoring thresholds to trigger alerts before reaching critical connection limits.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
Strengthen code review processes to catch potential resource leaks during development.
Enhance automated testing suites to include scenarios focusing on database connection handling.
Implement regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities proactively.
Tasks:
Add specific monitoring for database connection usage and leaks.
Conduct a thorough review of all codebases for potential resource leaks.
Schedule a knowledge-sharing session to educate the development team on best practices for resource management.
Conclusion:
The outage was promptly addressed by identifying and resolving the root cause â€“ an oversight in the authentication service code leading to a database connection leak. The incident highlighted the need for stricter code review processes and more comprehensive testing to catch such issues early in the development cycle. Additionally, ongoing efforts will focus on proactive monitoring and regular security audits to maintain a robust and resilient system.
